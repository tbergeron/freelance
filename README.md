freelance
=========

Because every other project management tool focus on collaboration.

- Q: **What happens if you're a freelancer who is working on multiple projects?**
- A: You end up with a half-assed solution focusing on _sharing_ your progress instead of actually having something that _helps_ you focus on what's needed to be done.

- Q: **Why are X/Y/Z solutions not working for you?**
- A: Because I always end up using a notebook instead of actually using a software. They always have some high monthly fees that you feel bad about paying since there's not much you really use after all. Worst part is, it's up to the _business_ to fix bugs and bring new features while it would be much more useful to let the _community_ help with this.

- Q: **What is this supposed to be?**
- A: I don't know yet, I don't even know what language/framework I want to use to build it. All I know is, the freelancer situation is a shitty one and we need a better tool.

- Q: **What needs a freelancer in your opinion?**
- A: We need project management with task tracking, time tracking that actually exports to something useful, file management, a simple wiki and a good overview page.
