### FAQ
---

- Q: **What happens if you're a freelancer who is working on multiple projects?**
- A: You end up with a half-assed solution focusing on _sharing_ your progress instead of actually having something that _helps_ you focus on what's needed to be done.

---

- Q: **Why are X/Y/Z solutions not working for you?**
- A: Because I always end up using a notebook instead of actually using a software. They always have some high monthly fees that you feel bad about paying since there's not much you really use after all. Worst part is, it's up to the _business_ to fix bugs and bring new features while it would be much more useful to let the _community_ help with this.

---

- Q: **What is this supposed to be?**
- A: A functional piece of software that makes a freelancer's life easy. A project management that focuses on getting shit done instead of sharing with your friends.

---

- Q: **What needs a freelancer in your opinion?**
- A: We need project management with task tracking, time tracking that actually exports to something useful, file management, a simple wiki, a _daily todo_ widget in which you can drag a few tasks for the day and a good overview page.

Other ideas: For developer it would be interesting to link repositories with projects, so we could reference tasks in commits/list commits per tasks. For designers and other document-oriented tasks it, file versioning could be a great idea. (_i.e. instead of adding a new file for every design revisions, simply upload a new revision on the same file_)
